# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the project here are a few conventions to stick too:

1. Commit messages should all lowercase (except for function or type names) with the format \<verb\>\<item\>. For example `implement chess 960 support`.
2. Error messages should be all lowercase (except for function or type names) with a format similar to "failed to perform \<name of function\>, additional details"
   - If wrapping another error end the first error with a colon and a space.

Thats it for now, if the need arises more items may be included at a later time.
